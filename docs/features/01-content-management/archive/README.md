## 🔄 Why These Were Archived

These documents were created during the iterative development process and served their purpose at the time. They have been archived because:

1. **Redundancy** - Multiple summary files covering the same information
2. **Outdated Status** - Checklists and progress trackers that are now 100% complete
3. **Consolidation** - Information has been consolidated into comprehensive guides
4. **Historical Context** - Kept for reference but not needed for current implementation

- **[../QUICK_START_GUIDE.md](../QUICK_START_GUIDE.md)** - Quick start guide

## 🗑️ Deletion Policy

These files may be safely deleted if needed, but are kept for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding the development process
- Troubleshooting similar issues in the future
